A chatroom demo app using React and Google's Firestore real time database.

## Getting Started
Open [https://journeyai-chat.web.app/](https://journeyai-chat.web.app/) to view it in a browser.
You can then choose a channel to join. Once you subscribe to a channel you'll receive all the previous messages posted to the channel to get you caught up. Any new messages posted to the channel while you are active will also be displayed.<br />

Alternatively, you can pass in a query string with the URL to immediately join any number of channels.
For example, [https://journeyai-chat.web.app/?room=nintendo,react-native,homebrew](https://journeyai-chat.web.app/?room=nintendo,react-native,homebrew) will instantly join you to the #nintendo, #react-native, and #homebrew channels. You'll receive messages posted to any of these channels and can post your own.<br />

The control panel shows you the channels you have joined. At anytime, you can leave a channel by clicking the [x] button to the right of the channel. Or, you can join more channels by typing the handle and clicking "Join".
